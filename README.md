# KVM SSH Connection and Port Forwarding Tool

`kvm-ssh` is a command-line tool designed to simplify SSH connections to KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) instances and provide easy port forwarding capabilities.

## Features

- List all running KVM virtual machines using information from dnsmasq status files
- Easily connect to a specific KVM virtual machine via SSH
- Forward multiple ports from a KVM virtual machine to the local machine
- Sensible defaults for common options

## Notes

- Ensure that the `ssh` command is available on your system.
- The tool reads VM information from `/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/<bridge_name>.status`.

## Tested Environment

This tool has been confirmed to work in the following environment:

```
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Debian
Description:    Debian GNU/Linux trixie/sid
Release:        n/a
Codename:       trixie
```

## Installation

To install `kvm-ssh`, clone the repository and build the tool:

```bash
$ go build
```

Make sure to place the built `kvm-ssh` binary in your system's PATH for easy access.

## Usage

### General Syntax

The general syntax for using `kvm-ssh` is as follows:

```
kvm-ssh <command> [options] <arguments>
```

Where `<command>` is one of `list`, `connect`, or `forward`.

### Default Values

- The default bridge name is set to `virbr0` for all commands.
- The default user is set to the value of the `USER` environment variable.

You only need to specify `--bridge` or `--user` if you want to use a different value.

### List all running KVM virtual machines

```bash
$ kvm-ssh list
```

To use a different bridge:

```bash
$ kvm-ssh list --bridge <bridge_name>
```

### Connect to a KVM virtual machine

```bash
$ kvm-ssh connect <vm_name>
```

If you need to specify a different user or bridge:

```bash
$ kvm-ssh connect --user <ssh_username> --bridge <bridge_name> <vm_name>
```

### Forward ports from a KVM virtual machine to the local machine

```bash
$ kvm-ssh forward --port <port1>,<port2>,... <vm_name>
```

To specify a different user or bridge:

```bash
$ kvm-ssh forward --user <ssh_username> --bridge <bridge_name> --port <port1>,<port2>,... <vm_name>
```

## Examples

1. List all running VMs (using default bridge virbr0):
   ```bash
   $ kvm-ssh list
   ```

2. List all running VMs on a specific bridge:
   ```bash
   $ kvm-ssh list --bridge br0
   ```

3. Connect to a VM named "ubuntu-vm" (using default bridge and user):
   ```bash
   $ kvm-ssh connect ubuntu-vm
   ```

4. Connect to a VM named "debian-vm" with a specific user and bridge:
   ```bash
   $ kvm-ssh connect --user john --bridge br0 debian-vm
   ```

5. Forward multiple ports from a VM (using default bridge and user):
   ```bash
   $ kvm-ssh forward --port 2375,40413 bookworm64-docker
   ```

6. Forward ports with specific user and bridge:
   ```bash
   $ kvm-ssh forward --user debian --bridge br0 --port 2375,40413 bookworm64-docker
   ```
